In Dwimordene,in Lorien
Seldom have walked the feet of Men,
Few mortal eyes have seen the light
That lies there ever,long and bright.
Galadriel!Galadriel!

Clear is the water of your well;
White is the star in your white hand;
Unmarred,unstained is leaf and land
In Dwimordene,in Lorien
More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.
